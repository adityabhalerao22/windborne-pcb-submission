PCB submission for Windborne challenge

The objective of this project was to create two Photodiode Transimpedance amplifier circuits to read incoming signals coming from two different diode lasers (one being a 632.8 HE-NE laser)
The initial gain settings for the TIA circuit were 10, 100 and 1000 V/V but were later modified to 10k, 110k and 1M V/V. The output from the TIA circuit should meet the following specifications:
Gain: 10k, 110k and 1M V/V.
Voltage output:  > 2V

TIA_documentation_Windborne.pdf is a snippet (part of a project) that contains the documentation, including schematic, simulation, layout, and testing for the Photodiode Transimpedance amplifier circuit.
