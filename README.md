PCB submission for Windborne challenge

The objective of this project was to create two Photodiode Transimpedance amplifier circuits to read incoming signals coming from two different diode lasers.
The initial gain settings for the TIA circuit were 10, 100 and 1000 V/V but were later modified to 10k, 110k and 1M V/V. The output from the TIA circuit should meet the following specifications:
Gain: 10k, 110k and 1M V/V.
Voltage output:  > 2V
